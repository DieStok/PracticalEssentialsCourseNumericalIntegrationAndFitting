##answer question b:
#first make a vector storing differences per timestep
differences = abs(x - 0.1 * exp(time)/(1+0.1*(exp(time)-1.)))
#then compute sum of these differences
totalDifferences = sum(differences)
#print these differences
print(totalDifferences)
```


```{r}
#In coding, you should observe DRY, Don't Repeat Yourself (as when later needing to change something you need to remember all the locations to do this making the risk for errors to occur large). Hence, in this answer code we put the code into an external function (which you can savely ignore) that allows us to change the timestep, call it again and plot the results. We'll run this with a large and a small time step.  Of course in your own code you can simply change the value of your timestep and rerun the same code.

##Answer question c:
####################

#for time step is 2
resultLargeStep = runSimpleNumericalIntegration(timeStep = 2, maxTime = 50)
resultLargeStep$timeExpended
resultLargeStep$Totdifferences
#you see that the numerical solution now oscillates around the analytical
#solution, at one timestep overshooting and the next undershooting the
#proper values. Also, the summed difference is quite large (~2.34)

#If you set the time step to be small things turn out a lot better.
resultSmallStep = runSimpleNumericalIntegration(timeStep = 0.01, maxTime = 50)
resultSmallStep$timeExpended
resultSmallStep$Totdifferences
#Here the integration works fine. The numerical solution closely follows
#the analytical solution. Also, the total sum of differences is much smaller: ~0.34
